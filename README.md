The objective of the game is to defeat the other submarines or more specifically, German Uboats using torpedos and other weapons.
### Don't forget to change the ip in the client program to the ip of your server computer.

Start the server.py program on one computer and join with either the client_input.py or client_no_input.py. (Up to five players)
The client_input file has an interface where the live view of the map stops when you select a command or option while
the other file constantaly updates the live view even when you are selecting options.

I made this project the summer of 2023 when I was in 7th grade, so the code is not very clean and my OOP skills were
not very developed yet.
